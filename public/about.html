          <h2>Me and "Artificial Intelligence":</h2>
          <br /><span
            >I chose to study Artificial Intelligence in university because of
            its vast potential to impact our daily lives in profound ways. From
            automated systems in transportation and manufacturing to virtual
            assistants in our homes and on our phones, AI is becoming
            increasingly integrated into our daily routines.</span
          ><br />

          <br /><span
            >Moreover, as someone who has always been fascinated by the
            intersection of technology and society, I believe that AI has the
            potential to address some of the most pressing challenges facing
            humanity today. From climate change to healthcare, AI has the
            potential to revolutionize the way we approach these complex issues
            and find solutions that were previously impossible.</span
          ><br />

          <br /><span
            >Furthermore, the job market for AI professionals is rapidly
            expanding, with companies across industries seeking individuals with
            a strong understanding of machine learning, data analysis, and
            algorithm development. By studying AI, I hope to gain the skills and
            knowledge necessary to be at the forefront of this exciting and
            rapidly evolving field.</span
          ><br />

          <br /><span
            >In short, my decision to study AI was motivated by my passion for
            technology, my desire to make a positive impact on society, and the
            exciting career opportunities that this field presents.</span

            <p class="text">
              In my spare time, one of my hobbies is going dancing. Dancing is
              an activity that brings me joy and helps me stay active and
              healthy. When I dance, I feel free and alive, and I get lost in
              the rhythm and the movement. It's a great way for me to express
              myself and release any stress or tension I may be feeling. Dancing
              is also a full-body workout that helps me stay in shape and
              maintain my physical health. I enjoy trying out different types of
              dance styles, from salsa to hip hop to ballet. Each dance style
              has its unique challenges and benefits, and I love the feeling of
              learning something new and mastering a new skill.

            <p class="text">
              In my spare time, one of my favorite hobbies is practicing
              calligraphy. I have been learning calligraphy for several years
              now, and it has become a passion of mine. Through practicing
              calligraphy, I have developed a deeper appreciation for the art of
              handwriting. The careful attention to detail and precision
              required to create beautiful lettering and designs have taught me
              patience and perseverance. In a world where everything seems to
              move so fast, calligraphy has become my refuge, a place where I
              can slow down and focus on the beauty of the written word. I enjoy
              trying out different calligraphy styles, from traditional Chinese
              brush calligraphy to modern calligraphy with a pointed pen. Each
              style presents its unique challenges and opportunities for
              creativity, and I love exploring new techniques and experimenting
              with different ink colors and paper textures.

            <p class="text">
              On weekends, one of my favorite hobbies is going to the movies. I
              love to immerse myself in a good film and escape into another
              world for a few hours. Comedy movies are my favorite genre, as I
              enjoy laughing and feeling uplifted after a long week. Going to
              the movies is a great way to relax and unwind after a busy week. I
              enjoy the entire movie-watching experience, from buying my ticket
              and popcorn to finding the perfect seat in the theater. The
              darkness of the cinema and the surround sound make me feel like
              I'm a part of the story, and I often find myself getting lost in
              the plot and characters. I especially enjoy watching comedy movies
              because they make me laugh and feel happy. Laughter is a powerful
              medicine that can lift my mood and reduce stress, and I always
              leave the theater feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

            <p class="text">
              In my spare time, one of my hobbies is drawing, although I
              wouldn't say that I'm particularly good at it. Despite my lack of
              skill, I find drawing to be a relaxing and enjoyable activity that
              allows me to express my creativity. Even though my drawings may
              not be perfect, I still find the process of creating something
              with my own hands to be incredibly satisfying. Drawing allows me
              to focus my mind and escape into a world of my own making. It's a
              great way for me to unwind after a long day and forget about the
              stresses of life for a little while. While I may not have the
              natural talent of a professional artist, I still enjoy
              experimenting with different techniques and styles. I love trying
              out new materials and tools, such as pencils, charcoal, and
              pastels, and seeing what kinds of effects I can create.

              During the winter and summer breaks, one of my favorite hobbies is
              traveling with my family. Exploring new places and experiencing
              different cultures is an incredibly rewarding experience, and it's
              something that we all look forward to every year. Traveling with
              family is a great way for us to bond and create lasting memories
              together. We enjoy planning our trips together and deciding on the
              places that we want to visit. Whether we're exploring historic
              landmarks or simply soaking up the local culture, we always have a
              great time together. One of the things that I love most about
              traveling is the opportunity to try new foods and cuisines.
              Sampling the local cuisine is a great way to experience the
              culture of a place and expand our taste buds. From street food to
              fine dining, we always make it a point to try out the local
              specialties and indulge in new flavors and spices.
